# Heimdal-Shell

This is a simple shell with a few customized commands. The core difference between Heimdal and other Shells like ```Bash``` is that Heimdal allows you to chat with someone else directly inside the Shell.

It's secured, at least as much as I could. To enter a chat you'll need to give the command a name + port + password like:

```bash
chat host mychat 9898 mysecretp@ssw0rd
```

Else just enter ```heimdal --help``` to know more about those commands.
